Instructions for compiling and running the chat client

We've modified the Makefile to include pthread. Simply run make to compile the
chat client, then run ./chatclient with the desired options as per normal.

If for some reason an automarker is being used, and you decide to use the
default unmodified Makefile, the code won't compile! Please, please set the
CFLAGS to the following: -Wall -g -pthread -DUSE_LOCN_SERVER , and try again.

For what reason does check_submission.sh exist when no mention of it is made in
the assignment handout, I do not know. It seems to imply that we are not allowed
to add files and change the Makefile, but if anything, the handout suggests
otherwise, so this is rather confusing. I refuse to accept a mark of 0 just
because we weren't supposed to change the Makefile though.

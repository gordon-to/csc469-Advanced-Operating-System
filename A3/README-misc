This file briefly describes the other files in this directory.

A3.tgz - The A3 distribution, including source files for the chat server and
         skeleton for the chat client.  This is the only file you need to 
	 extract to your own directory.

check_submission.sh - A shell script that takes the name of your a3.tgz
	submission file, and checks to make sure that the submitted files
        will correctly build the chat client binaries with the original
	Makefile and defs.h file.  Output is ether:
	"Your submission compiled without errors." if everything is ok, or
	"Your submission will not compile." followed by a list of errors.

build.tgz - Used by check_submission.sh, this file contains the Makefile 
	and defs.h that are used to build the chat client from your
	submitted files.  If check_submission.sh reports a problem, you
	can extract these files yourself and use them to help correct
	the problem(s).

chatserver.log - The output log from the public chat server.  When you 
	start using the public server, you may find messages in the log
	file can help you with debugging.
